// Q5. 
// You are working on a large codebase, when you discover a bug. 
// The current commit has the bug, but a commit from several months ago does not.
// Given a sorted list of 100 commits, write a function that returns an object 
// containing the commit and index.  Your solution must run in log(n) time.

// example input
