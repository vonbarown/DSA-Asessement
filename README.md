# Pursuit Core Web DSA Assessment

This assessment is closed book. However you can use your text editor and `node` to run your code.  Start by carefully reading all questions on the Canvas Quiz then work on your solutions here.  You are not allowed to use any other resources on this assessment.

For each of the coding questions, there is a `.js` file in this repo. Carefully read the question and understand the code provided. You will not need to modify the existing code, there will be a function were you are going to code your solution. For the non-coding questions answer them on canvas.
